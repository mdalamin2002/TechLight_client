# User Settings Module - Documentation

## Overview
The User Settings module has been completely refactored into a modular, maintainable architecture with proper separation of concerns. Each major feature is now isolated in its own component with full functionality.

## 📝 Notes for Backend Developer

### Suggested Schema for User Preferences:
```javascript
{
  email: "user@example.com",
  preferences: {
    notifications: {
      orders: { email: true, push: true },
      promotions: { email: true, push: false },
      account: { email: true, push: true },
      newsletter: { weekly: false }
    },
    privacy: {
      profileVisibility: true,
      showOrderHistory: true
    },
    appearance: {
      theme: "dark", // "light" | "dark" | "system"
    },
    locale: {
      language: "en",
      currency: "USD"
    }
  },
  accountStatus: "active", // "active" | "deactivated" | "deleted"
  deactivatedAt: null,
  deletedAt: null
}
```

---

## 🐛 Known Limitations

1. **Notification Settings**: Currently localStorage-only (no backend persistence)
2. **Data Export**: Shows "coming soon" message (no backend endpoint)
3. **Account Deactivation**: Not implemented on backend
4. **Multi-language**: UI labels not translated (needs i18n)
5. **Password change**: Requires recent login (Firebase security)

✅ **Security First**: Re-auth, confirmation dialogs, validation  
✅ **User Experience**: Clear feedback, error handling, loading states  
✅ **Accessibility**: Labels, ARIA attributes, keyboard navigation  
✅ **Maintainability**: Well-documented, consistent patterns
